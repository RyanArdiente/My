      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Jeremy Lin has enjoyed a solid year backing up Kemba Walker for the Charlotte Hornets. After the inferno that was Linsanity, he didn’t become a superstar, but he also did not drop off the face of the map. He’s just sort of a guy, a decent back up point guard on an okay team.

But if you’ve watched him play this year, surely the first thing you’ve noticed is that hair. NBA broadcasters are with you, and an enterprising NBA fan mashed up 3:22 worth of befuddled commentators trying to make sense of it.</p></div>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">place</i>NBA Rumor Roundup</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Boston Celtics: President of basketball operations Danny Ainge is armed with a lot of future draft picks and he is trying to land a top player. According to Sportando, one player Ainge likes is Denver's Danilo Gallinari. Gallinari had his contract renegotiated on Aug. 2 and is signed through 2018 if he picks up his 2017-18 player option.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles Clippers: Could the Clippers trade one of their stars? ESPN's Zach Lowe writes: "Several league sources insist that if Doc Rivers, the Clippers coach, general manager, head chef and lead custodian, were forced to pick one of the three (Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan) to flip, it would likely be Griffin -- in part because he knows Griffin would bring back the most. (He'd prefer to flip none, obviously). Griffin is entering the late stages of his prime, and unless he learns to shoot 3s, his jumpy game might not age well."</p>
      <p>Sacramento Kings: According to ESPN.com's Marc Stein, the Kings are willing to deal Rudy Gay for the "right deal" -- a top talent and possibly future draft picks. Stein reports the Kings rejected a swap of Gay for Eric Gordon and Alonzo Gee from New Orleans.</p>
      <p>Memphis Grizzlies: According to ESPN.com's Marc Stein, the Grizzlies have been trying to find out the interest for Jeff Green and Courtney Lee. Per Stein, Zach Randolph and Tony Allen are players the Grizzlies want to keep, along with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles Lakers: According to ESPN.com's Marc Stein, the Lakers have made Roy Hibbert, Brandon Bass, Nick Young and Lou Williams available in the trade market.</p>
      <p>Washington Wizards: The Wizards lost to the Nuggets on Thursday and after the game a players-only meeting took place. "It’s kind of similar to the past years. We’ve been through the same thing," Bradley Beal told The Washington Post. “It always takes a team meeting or two to figure it out, but we’re at the point now where we know what we need to do. we’re still in a great position to make the playoffs with 40 or however many games we have left. We have a great opportunity to make a run so it’s up to us to be able to put it together and get out here and get some wins.”</p>
      <p>New York Knicks: The team reportedly has some interest in Atlanta's Jeff Teague, but nothing came of it. They may look to upgrade the point guard spot by the Feb. 18 trade deadline and that could mean Jose Calderon would be on the move. Calderon says the rumor mill doesn't bother him. "We’ll talk in the next few weeks," Calderon told Newsday. “It’s what it is. I’m used to it. Like I always say, we don’t know what’s going to happen. I’m really happy where I am right now, with the role I have, the way we’re building something here and how the team is playing. But you’re always one call away from something changing." ... Calderon's contract expires in 2017 and there is a chance he could be waived via the stretch provision in July to increase the Knicks' salary cap room.
      </p>
      <p>Phoenix Suns: Many observers of the NBA believe the Suns will make a trade by Feb. 18. GM Ryan McDonough sounds like someone in the mood to deal. “I think we’ll be active, I think we’ll be active for sure,” McDonough told Arizona Sports 98.7 FM. “Will we do a deal or how many deals will we do, I don’t know at this point. The deadline is (a few weeks away) and usually the conversations at this point are just kind of two teams feeling each other out, seeing what teams may be looking to do, what they may be looking to add positionally in terms of draft picks or what have you.” ... The player likely to be traded is forward Markieff Morris. “But like I said, our preference at this point is to probably make at least one deal, and maybe make multiple ones depending on what’s available," said McDonough.</p>
      <p>New Orleans Pelicans: On Thursday, John Reid of The Times-Picayune had a Q & A with readers and here's what he wrote about possible trades: "New Orleans is getting plenty of trade inquires on Ryan Anderson but appears to be reluctant to get a deal done. The Pelicans are also listening to offers on Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans. I think how well this team plays over the next two weeks will determine if (GM Dell) Demps make a trade deal."</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">whatshot</i>NBA Insider: David Blatt's firing will suit James just fine</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Born, raised and now returned to northeast Ohio, LeBron James apparently has been out of place even though he’s back where he belongs.

The Cleveland Cavaliers’ decision nine days ago to fire David Blatt and promote associate head coach Tyronn Lue despite a 30-11 record was done for numerous reasons, including one intended to speed up a Cavaliers team that rules the East but must overcome fast-player Golden State (not to mention San Antonio and Oklahoma City) in the West if they intend to win James his third NBA title and bring one home to Cleveland for the first time.

A 34-point home loss to the Warriors four days before Blatt was fired — as well as a four-point loss at San Antonio four days before that — made that painfully clear, particularly it seems to Cavaliers General Manager David Griffin.

Statistical analytics suggest James is the league’s most efficient — if underutilized — player getting down the floor in transition. It’s a premise Lue addressed the day he took the job, saying all his players needed to shape up if they intended to fully use the talents of James, Kyrie Irving and others.

James has lived and played his entire NBA career in the East, but in a recent conversation with California-born and Arizona-raised teammate Richard Jefferson, James came clean and admitted he just maybe has been a man out of his place his whole life.

“Talking to R.J., I feel like I should have been a West Coast player growing up,” he said, “because they run the floor on the West Coast and on the East Coast we dribble the ball and things of that nature. One thing since I was a kid, I’ve always loved to run the floor.”

A six-time member of NBA all-defensive teams, James since Blatt’s firing has defended against the notion he pushed for the dismissal of a man who likely wouldn’t have been hired in summer 2014 if James had become a free agent two weeks earlier or if the Cavaliers had waited just a little longer to name a coach. Blatt was hired after a career spent in Europe to coach a young team. When James revealed his desire to return home two weeks later, everything changed.

James told reporters last week he has never undermined or disrespected a coach since the day he first picked up a basketball, and he invited them to ask any of his coaches from little league to the NBA if he had ever done so. With that said, James called himself a smart player who has voiced his opinions to every NBA coach for whom he has ever played and will continue to do so with Lue.

James and Lue have been friends for years, but Lue promises he will hold his superstar accountable and James countered by saying Lue’s call to play faster isn’t his doing.

“This is what Coach wants to do, and this is what we’re doing to do,” James said. “This isn’t a LeBron thing.”

A faster pace should allow Irving and James to attack and create easier baskets before the opposing defense gets set. If not, it still allows more time to run an offense that hasn’t yet learned how to better use Kevin Love’s passing abilities or low-post game.

“Getting up the floor at 19 seconds [remaining on the 24-second shot clock] instead of 15 gives us four more seconds,” James said. “Some people think four seconds is nothing. But in our league, four seconds is a ton of time. … I definitely know the difference. I’ve played at a slow pace and I’ve played at a fast pace before in my career. You can see it, you can sense it and you can feel it. For the average fan that doesn’t know, just go look at Golden State game and then go look at a Memphis game.”</p></div>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">whatshot</i>LeBron James Becomes Youngest Player in NBA History to Score 26K Points</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 26,000 points Friday night in a 114-106 win over the Detroit Pistons.

According to ESPN Stats & Info, James beat Kobe Bryant to the milestone by more than a year. James currently ranks 17th on the NBA's all-time scoring list, but he won't occupy that position much longer. He is in line to eclipse Kevin Garnett (26,071 points) for 16th place in a matter of games.

However, passing Garnett is merely the means to a far more historically significant end.

If we use last season as a guide, James is in line to fly up the league's all-time scoring list now that he's cracked 26,000 points—with future Hall of Famers Tim Duncan and Paul Pierce in his sights. During the 2014-15 season, James scored 1,743 points in just 69 games—good for a nightly average of 25.3. The four-time MVP's per-game total this season has ticked down slightly to 24.9 (entering Friday), but the fact that he's already close to 1,100 total points this year following a 20-point performance Friday night suggests he could come close to totaling 2,000 points in a season for the 10th time in his career.

Should 27,000 points come into play as the Cavaliers jockey for playoff position, James could jump to as high as No. 10 on the all-time scoring list by the time the regular season comes to a close. That would mean eclipsing Hakeem Olajuwon, Oscar Robertson, Dominique Wilkins and John Havlicek along the way.</p></div>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>HOUSTON -- The Houston Rockets have petitioned the NBA to rescind the four technical fouls administered to center Dwight Howard in the past two games, according to a source.

Howard was ejected for picking up two technical fouls in each of the past two games. He leads the NBA with 12 technicals this season and is tied with the Clippers' Blake Griffin with two ejections.</p></div>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Over the weekend, Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard was ejected from a one-point loss against the Washington Wizards. Why? He was frustrated. Really, really frustrated.

Towards the end of an extremely physical game that Howard later compared to a UFC match, the three-time Defensive Player of the Year shoved Wizards center Nene after he caught an elbow in the ribs. The Rockets might be the most disappointing team in the NBA, and injuries to some of their key players are a huge reason why, Howard included. Despite averaging 14.4 points and 11.8 rebounds per game, the 30-year-old has missed 10 of Houston's 50 games due to various injuries this season.

He's still a dominant force when he absolutely has to be, but that same night-to-night consistency from his prime is long gone. Still, the Rockets are worse on both ends when he isn't in the game—probably because he does stuff like this on a regular basis:</p></div>
